# Competetive Programming Repo

## This is my repo of my attempt to become a good competetive programmer

This is a part of the CP Challenge 2.0 organised by the C.o.L.D Club, School of Engineering.

I solve questions from teh CP-31 sheet of tle-eliminators, and participate in contests regularly on codeforces.

I have little experience of Competetive Programming before this. I am looking forward to a great start into the world of competetive programming.
